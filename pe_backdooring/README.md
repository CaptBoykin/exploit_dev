# NOTE!
All payloads are `shell_reverse_tcp` to `LHOST: 192.168.1.199` on `PORT: 9999` unless noted with it saying 'calc/calculator'.


# PE File Hacking / Backdoor / Trojan
My progression to learning backdooring and embedding payloads in normal Windows Executables (PE files)!  Some references I used in all this:

* https://samsclass.info/127/proj/p8aim-r.htm
* https://samsclass.info/127/proj/p8bim.htm
* https://sector876.blogspot.com/2013/03/backdooring-pe-files-part-1.html
* https://pentest.blog/art-of-anti-detection-2-pe-backdoor-manufacturing/
* https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/20240/The-Beginners-Guide-to-Codecaves

I used a run of the mill 7zip installer
* https://www.7-zip.org/

The flow of the folders goes as such
`new section -> code caves -> encoding`

With each incorporating things from the previous.

## Legend
* CC: Code Cave
* XOR: Xor'd payload and likely stub also
* No NOPS: Adjustments were made to minimize NOPs
* Buried:  Payload and stub were buried in native data (concealment)

## Tools Used
* HxD
* Immunity Debugger
* LordPE
* msfvenom
